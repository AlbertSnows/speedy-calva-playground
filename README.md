# Calva Playground

This is a super quick repo explaining all the necessary bits to get a quick simple calva session up.
Very useful for quick testing ond a different machine than the one you're used to.
I intend to use this repo in case I ever need to refer back to a quick testing playground on a different machine.

## Instructions

First off, install the [calva](https://calva.io/getting-started/) plugin.

Running the "Quick Start" with a node repl command should "just work" but there may be problems.
In which case, you may be out of luck. The rest of this file is more information about other aspects of a clojure install.

## Clojure Install (Alternative Information)

Get [java](https://adoptium.net/download/).
Get [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download).
Install [clojure](https://github.com/clojure/tools.deps.alpha/wiki/clj-on-Windows) (instructions for if on windows).
Will need [.Net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download).
If execution scripts are disabled, refer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4037939/powershell-says-execution-of-scripts-is-disabled-on-this-system).
Be sure to restart VSCode if none of these are recognized in the terminal.
